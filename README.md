## 📖 Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will file a car insurance claim based on various parameters such as driving history, vehicle details, and past claims. The model helps insurance companies optimize risk assessment and reduce fraudulent claims.

---

## ✨ Project Features
✔️ Predicts the likelihood of an insurance claim  
✔️ Uses **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** for prediction  
✔️ Web interface to input customer data  
✔️ Visualizes key insights from data  
✔️ REST API for integrating with other systems  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer information including:
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, marital status, etc.
- **Vehicle Details:** Type, model year, previous claims
- **Driving History:** Past violations, accident history

## 📊 Model Performance

Accuracy: 88%

Precision: 87%

Recall: 89%

F1-score: 88%

ROC-AUC Score : 0.88

Algorithm Used: Random Forest

Multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Adaboost, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes, and ANN were used and the best model was selected.
Model evaluation is available in the car_insurance_pred.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

The explainability of the model was analysed using SHAP and LIME.
